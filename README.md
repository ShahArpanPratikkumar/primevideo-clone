This project is a Prime Video Clone built to replicate the core features and user interface of Amazon Prime Video. It includes a responsive homepage, movie and TV show listings, and a modern UI design inspired by the original platform. The project was developed to practice front-end development skills, improve understanding of layouts, components, and user experience, and demonstrate the use of web technologies in building real-world applications.

If you want, tell me:


which technologies you used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.), or


whether this is a frontend-only or full-stack project


and I can rewrite it to sound more professional or beginner-friendly 👍
